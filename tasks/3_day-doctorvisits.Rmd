# Background
In this study, we will use cross-section data from an Australian health survey between 1977 and 1978. Your task is to predict the number of illnesses in the past two weeks based on the self-reported health score, while controlling fo the income, age, and gender.

## Codebook
```{r}
?AER::DoctorVisits
```

# Task
1) Build models
You need to build Poisson regression model for testing our hypothesis.

2) Report results
Create a single table that contains all parameter estimates, std. errors, t statistics, and p values.

# Solution
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(performance)
data("DoctorVisits", package = "AER")
```

# Building the models
```{r}

```

# Printing the results in a table
```{r}

```

# Checking assumptions
```{r}

```

# Adjustments to the model (if needed)
```{r}

```
